# Batchline

Ready-mix concrete plant operations platform. Design spec: see the published
Batchline artifact from this project's planning session for the full system
design (all 12 modules, business rules, integrations, RBAC, rollout plan).

This codebase covers all 12 modules from the original system scope, across
**Phase 1 (Foundation)**, **Phase 2 (Production + Fleet)**, **Phase 3
(Quality & Compliance + driver mobile app)**, **Phase 4 (Pumps + integration
webhooks + Reports/KPIs)**, and **Material Receiving** (built out of
sequence to close a gap in the original module list) — a real database,
real CRUD, and the batching physics (yield factor, tolerance, drum timer,
return policy, plant KPIs) actually computing from live data, not
placeholders.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Actions). Back-office pages live in the
  `src/app/(app)` route group (sidebar layout); the driver app
  (`src/app/driver`) is a separate route tree with its own minimal layout —
  they share only the root `layout.tsx` (fonts, HTML shell).
- Prisma 5 ORM, SQLite for local dev (swap the datasource to PostgreSQL for
  production — one line in `prisma/schema.prisma` plus `DATABASE_URL`)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Oswald / IBM Plex Sans / IBM Plex Mono, matching the Batchline design system

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npx prisma db push      # create/sync the local SQLite database
npx prisma db seed      # load a demo plant, mix design, customer, project, fleet
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the back office, or
[http://localhost:3000/driver](http://localhost:3000/driver) for the driver
app (pick "Karim Adel" or "Hassan Zaki" — there's no login yet, see below).

> Windows + PowerShell: if `npm run dev` fails with "running scripts is
> disabled on this system", either run it from Command Prompt instead, or
> run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
> once in a regular PowerShell window.

## What's implemented

**Phase 1 — Foundation**
- **Plants** — registry, currency/timezone, plus batching tolerance and
  alert-threshold configuration (drum timer limit, return absorption
  threshold)
- **Silos** — live level tracking, low-threshold alert surfaced on both the
  Silos screen and the dashboard
- **Mix Design** — recipe library with a component editor; design volume is
  computed from real specific-gravity data via the absolute-volume method
  (ACI 211.1 style)
- **Suppliers** — vendor master + material catalog (specific gravity,
  absorption — feeds the Mix Design and moisture-correction calculations)
- **Customers, Projects, Employees, Reservations** — CRUD with the credit-hold
  rule from the design spec

**Phase 2 — Production + Fleet**
- **Production** — release a confirmed reservation as a batch ticket (targets
  snapshotted from the mix design, scaled to the requested volume); record
  actual scale weights and aggregate moisture readings; out-of-tolerance
  components are flagged automatically against each material's configured
  tolerance
- Completing a batch **deducts real mass from the matching silo/hopper
  inventory** — the same numbers the Silos screen and dashboard alerts read
- **Fleet** — truck registry (drum capacity, agitation spec, GPS device ID,
  status) and the driver roster
- **Trips** — live trip board with a real-time drum-rotation timer against
  the plant's configured limit; status flow from loading through discharge;
  closing with a return applies the design spec's return & discount policy
  (no charge under the absorption threshold, partial credit above it, full
  waste past the drum-timer window)

**Phase 3 — Quality & Compliance + driver mobile app**
- **Test Batches & Lab Results** — sample a trip (slump, air content, temp),
  record cylinder breaks at any age, pass/fail computed against the target
  strength; every result traces back through its trip to a specific truck,
  driver, and batch ticket
- **Compliance Certificates** — per mix design, with an expiry warning chip
  inside 60 days and an expired flag past it
- **Driver mobile app** (`/driver`) — a phone-first surface with no
  back-office chrome: pick yourself (no auth yet, see below), see your
  assigned trips with a live drum-timer countdown, advance status through
  the delivery, capture a photo, and confirm with a signed-by name — closes
  full or with a return through the same policy logic as the dispatcher
  trip board
- **Audit trail** — every write across all three phases logs
  actor/role/module/record/reason to `AuditEvent`

**Phase 4 — Pumps, integration webhooks, Reports & KPIs**
- **Pumps** — pump registry (boom/line/stationary, reach, hourly + standby
  rate) and a booking calendar that schedules a pump against a reservation
- **Integration webhooks** — `POST /api/telematics/ping` (GPS provider →
  truck location, identified by `gpsDeviceId`) and `POST
  /api/scada/silo-reading` (sensor-fed silo level, distinct from the manual
  dashboard override) — real endpoints, tested directly with `curl`, not
  mocked UI. Results surface on the Fleet and Silos screens (last position,
  "sensor 9:47 PM" vs "no sensor feed").
- **Reports & KPIs** (`/reports`) — daily/7-day production volume, average
  batch deviation, cylinder pass rate, slump conformance, return rate,
  average truck cycle time, and silo days-of-cover, all computed live from
  the same tables every other screen writes to. Verified against
  hand-calculated expected values. Revenue/cost/AR metrics are deliberately
  absent — see below.

**Material Receiving**
- Weighbridge-style capture (gross/tare weight, net computed — never entered
  directly) against a supplier PO, with a variance-vs-PO flag beyond ±2%
- A QC gate: a receipt sits at `PENDING` until Quality passes, holds, or
  rejects it — **nothing reaches silo or hopper inventory until QC passes
  it**, mirroring the same posting pattern as completing a production batch

## Not yet implemented (see the rollout plan)

The PLC/batching-scale and weighbridge integrations are still simulated
through manual entry (Production's "record actuals" form stands in for a
real scale readout). Auth/session-based RBAC is also not wired up — the
driver app uses a cookie-based "pick yourself" flow standing in for a real
login, and back-office routes are open. Financial reporting (revenue per m³,
material cost variance, AR aging) needs a pricing/invoicing data model
(customer price lists, invoices, payments) that doesn't exist yet — the
Reports page says so explicitly rather than showing a fabricated number.

A few simplifications worth knowing about: batch completion picks the
*first* matching silo/hopper for a material type rather than an
operator-chosen one (Reports' silo days-of-cover inherits the same
limitation when two silos share a material type); delivered volume before a
return is the reservation's requested volume rather than a measured
unit-weight test; and the delivery photo is stored as a base64 data URL in
the database (fine for demo volumes — swap for real object storage, e.g.
S3-compatible, before production traffic).
